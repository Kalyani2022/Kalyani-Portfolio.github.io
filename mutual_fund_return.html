      <p>Hello there! Welcome to my Data Analyst / Data Engineer portfolio showcasing the <span class="highlight">Best
          Mutual Fund Finder</span> project.</p>
      <p>In collaboration with a skilled team of two and under the guidance of a professional Expert, I've
        embarked on a journey to create an innovative solution that simplifies investment decisions through data-driven
        insights.</p>
      <p>The core objective of this project is to analyze mutual fund returns, empowering users to make informed
        investment choices. Our robust analysis engine, crafted using Python and MySQL, processes historical data and
        presents users with clear visualizations of fund performance, risk, and historical trends.</p>
      <div class="project-details">
        <p>The <span class="highlight">Key Highlights</span> of this project include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Utilizing Python's data manipulation libraries to extract, transform, and load mutual fund data from
            diverse sources.</li>
          <li>Implementing advanced analytics to calculate returns, volatility, and risk-adjusted metrics.</li>
          <li>Designing an intuitive user interface that displays fund profiles and comparison metrics.</li>
          <li>Integrating MySQL to efficiently store and manage large-scale financial datasets.</li>
          <li>Deploying the application on Amazon Web Services (AWS) to ensure accessibility and scalability.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>Based on the analysis conducted in the Jupyter Notebook, here are some key findings:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Data Collection and Cleaning</strong>:
          <ul>
            <li>The dataset contains information on various mutual funds, including their returns over different periods
              (1M, 3M, 6M, 1Y, 3Y, 5Y).</li>
            <li>Missing values in the numerical columns were handled by filling them with the mean of each column.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</strong>:
          <ul>
            <li>The dataset was explored to understand the distribution and characteristics of the mutual funds.</li>
            <li>Various plots were generated to visualize the data, including bar plots, box plots, and scatter plots.
            </li>
            <li>A correlation matrix was created to understand the relationships between different numerical variables.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Ranking of Mutual Funds</strong>:
          <ul>
            <li>Custom rankings were created based on the returns over different periods.</li>
            <li>The top 20 mutual funds were identified based on a custom ranking score.</li>
            <li>A bar plot was generated to visualize the top 20 mutual funds based on the custom ranking.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Clustering</strong>:
          <ul>
            <li>Mutual funds were clustered based on their performance using the KMeans algorithm.</li>
            <li>The dataset was scaled and imputed to handle missing values before clustering.</li>
            <li>Four clusters were identified, and each mutual fund was assigned to one of these clusters.</li>
            <li>A scatter plot was generated to visualize the clusters and their centroids.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Principal Component Analysis (PCA)</strong>:
          <ul>
            <li>PCA was performed to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset.</li>
            <li>The first two principal components were extracted and used for further analysis.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Mutual Fund Performance Prediction</strong>:
          <ul>
            <li>A RandomForestRegressor model was trained to predict the Net Asset Value (NAV) of mutual funds.</li>
            <li>The model was evaluated using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), which was found to be approximately
              560.05.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Sharpe Ratio Calculation</strong>:
          <ul>
            <li>The Sharpe Ratio was calculated for each mutual fund to assess its risk-adjusted return.</li>
            <li>Mutual funds were ranked based on their Sharpe Ratio and 5Y returns.</li>
            <li>The top recommended mutual funds were identified based on these rankings.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>These findings provide valuable insights into the performance and characteristics of various mutual funds,
        helping investors make informed decisions.</p>
